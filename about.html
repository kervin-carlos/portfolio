    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Kervin!
      I'm an aspiring IT professional with a strong passion for web development and technology. I've been fascinated by computers ever since I was a kid, and that curiosity has only grown over the years. I'm a quick learner and an academic achiever who enjoys taking on new challenges, especially when it comes to building or exploring something tech-related. I love solving problems, experimenting with code, and continuously improving my skill set. Welcome to my portfolio—where I showcase my tech stack, who I am, and what I’m working on.
      <br>
      Professionally, I aspire to become a full-stack developer and contribute to innovative tech solutions that create real impact. I'm currently focused on gaining hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development to build efficient and user-friendly applications. My goal is to be part of a dynamic, forward-thinking team that values creativity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. I’m excited about future opportunities where I can grow, learn, and apply my skills to meaningful projects.
